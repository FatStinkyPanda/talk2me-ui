Continue development and working on next steps, TODOs, and tasks. Find any and all gaps, and use the README file if needed
  to help identify gaps. If there are any errors or pre-existing or existing issues, please fix them as well, fixing the root
  cause while maintaining maximum features and integrations, always fixing and never removing features.
